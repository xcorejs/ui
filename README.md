Xcore UI
=======

Flexible, themeable React component library for applications with advanced UI design requirements which is suitable for creating tailored design systems.

🌪 Unlimited customization and theming  
📱 Fully responsive props and breakpoint aliases support  
🔌️ Superpowered by [Styled system](https://styled-system.com/) and its paradigm  
💅️ Based on [styled components](https://styled-components.com)  
⚡️ Inspired by [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) + [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/)

## Future development
Xcore UI development is currently closed and will continue in a bug-fix mode only.
Next generation component library which will take place of Xcore UI is Anolis UI, currently in development.

See [Anolis UI on GitHub](https://github.com/anolis-ui/anolis-ui)
